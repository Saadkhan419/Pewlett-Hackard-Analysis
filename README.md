# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# PURPOSE
  The purpose of this analysis was to determine number of retiring employees per title and identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
  
# RESULTS  
    - Total employees of retirement age are 90,398
    -  Most of the employees retiring are from the Engineering department, with Senior position.
    - Total employee eligible for mentorship programs are 1940
    - For every 45 vacancies there are roughly 1 mentor.

# SUMMARY
As the silver-tsunami begins to impact roughly 90,400 roles will need to be filled. Which means that almost a third of the Pewlett-hackard emplyees are going to be retiring. 
As for the question whether there are enough employees to mentor the next generation, in my opinion there are not enough mentors to effectively train the new generation. For every mentor there will be almost 45 employees to be trained. I would suggest to change the eligibility date in order to have more mentors.
